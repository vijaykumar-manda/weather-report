#Project Name: Weather Report Application

Description:
The Weather Report Application is a web-based platform that offers real-time weather information and location details to users. This project effectively combines frontend and backend technologies, as well as external APIs, to provide a seamless and informative weather forecasting experience. Here are the key components and details of the project:

Frontend (React):

The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend (Spring):

The backend is implemented using the Spring framework, specifically Spring Boot. Spring Boot simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a streamlined way to create robust, production-ready backend services.
External APIs:

To fetch weather information, the application integrates with the OpenWeather API. This API provides a wealth of weather-related data, including current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical weather data.
For location details, the application connects to the GeoDB API. This API offers access to geographical and location-based data, including details about cities, regions, and countries.
Functionality:

Users can enter a location or allow the application to access their current location through geolocation.
The application communicates with the external APIs to retrieve up-to-date weather and location data.
It then displays this information to the user in an easy-to-understand format, including current weather conditions, forecasts, temperature, humidity, and more.
Deployment:

The frontend is deployed on Vercel, a popular platform for hosting React applications. Vercel offers seamless deployment and hosting solutions with built-in CD/CI (Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration).
The backend is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, a fully managed service for deploying and scaling applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk ensures that your Spring application is reliable and can handle varying levels of traffic.
